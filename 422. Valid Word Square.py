#Given a sequence of words, check whether it forms a valid word square.
#
#A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).
#
#Note:
#The number of words given is at least 1 and does not exceed 500.
#Word length will be at least 1 and does not exceed 500.
#Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
